The left pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the right pointer starts at the end of the array. We then enter a while loop that continues until the left pointer equals the right pointer. Inside the while loop, we calculate the sum of the numbers at the left and right pointers. If this sum equals the target, we return the indices of these numbers (plus one because the problem specifies 1-indexed). If the sum is less than the target, we increment the left pointer. If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement the right pointer. This ensures that we always consider the largest possible sum when the sum is less than the target and the smallest possible sum when the sum is greater than the target. This ensures that we find the correct pair of numbers.\n<jupyter_code>\nclass Solution(object):\n    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type numbers: List[int]\n        :type target: int\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        left, right = 0, len(numbers) -

The right child is called with the updated range (val, upper) and the left child is called with the updated range (lower, val).\n\n# If both recursive calls return True, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n# Finally, the main function calls the helper function with the root of the tree as the argument.\n\n# This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because it visits each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced, but can be O(log n) in the average case and O(n) in the best case when the tree is balanced.\n\n# This solution

We are visiting each node exactly once.\n# Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, the queue will contain all the nodes of the last level.\n\n# This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It starts by adding the root node to the queue. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it processes the nodes at the current level by removing them from the queue and adding their children to the queue. The nodes are added to the result list in the order they are processed. The flag variable is used to determine the order of the nodes at each level. If the flag is True, the nodes are added in the normal order. If the flag is False, the nodes are reversed before being added to the result list. After processing all the nodes at the current level, the flag is flipped and the process repeats for the next level.\n\n# The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because each node is processed exactly once.

single number in the target.\n# The space complexity is because of the recursion stack during the backtracking process. In the worst case scenario, we have to store all the numbers in the target.\n\n# The backtracking algorithm is used here to solve this problem. It is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems that incrementally build candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.\n\n# The backtracking algorithm is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that tries to build the solution incrementally. It uses a stack to keep track of the path it has taken to reach the current state of the solution.\n\n# In this problem, the backtracking algorithm is used to find all combinations of candidates that sum up to the target. The algorithm starts by trying to add the first candidate to the combination. If the sum of the combination is less than the target, the algorithm tries to add the next candidate to the combination. If the sum of the combination is equal to the target, the combination is added to the result. If the sum of the combination is greater than the target, the combination is abandoned and the algorithm tries to add the next candidate to the combination. This process is repeated until all candidates have been tried.\n\n# The algorithm uses recursion to add candidates to the combination and remove them when the sum of the combination is greater than the target. The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the path it has taken to reach the current state of the solution.\n\n# The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N^t) because in the worst case scenario, we have to go through all the candidates for every single number in the target.

The Excel sheet is 1-indexed, meaning the first column is 'A', the second is 'B', and so on. The column number increases by 1 for each subsequent letter. The conversion is done by converting the number to base 26, where the digits range from 0 to 25. The corresponding characters are 'A' to 'Z'.The solution is to repeatedly divide the number by 26 and convert the remainder to a character. The process is repeated until the number is 0.

If it is, it updates the max count and resets the modes list to contain only the new value. If the count is equal to the max count, it adds the new value to the modes list.

linked list. The slow pointer will point to the middle of the linked list. The fast pointer will point to the end of the linked list. We then recursively call the function for the left and right half of the linked list and connect them to the root of the binary search tree.\n\n# The slow pointer is used to find the middle of the linked list because it moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the linked list.\n\n# The time complexity is O(N log N) because we are dividing the linked list into two halves at each level of the recursion tree and we are doing this log N times.

solution uses a Trie data structure to store the words. It then iterates over the board and checks if each character is in the Trie. If it is, it performs a depth-first search to find all words starting with that character. The search is performed by marking the current character as visited by replacing it with a special character, and then checking all its neighbors. If a word is found, it is added to the result list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m*n*3^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the board, and k is the length of the longest word. This is because in the worst case, we have to perform a depth-first search on each character of the board, and for each search, we have 3 possible directions to go. The space complexity is O(sum(k)), where k is the length of the words. This is because we need to store the words in the Trie.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input words are all unique.

The function DFS is used to find all the possible solutions. The function DFS takes three parameters: queens, xy_diff, and xy_sum. The queens parameter is a list that stores the column index of the queen in each row. The xy_diff and xy_sum are used to check if a queen can be placed in the current position. If the difference of the row index and the column index is not in xy_diff, and the sum of the row index and the column index is not in xy_sum, then a queen can be placed in the current position.\n\n# The base case of the recursion is when the number of queens is equal to n. In this case, the current arrangement of queens is a solution, so it is added to the result list.\n\n# The recursive case is when the number of queens is less than n. In this case, for each column, if a queen can be placed in the current position, a recursive call is made to place the next queen.\n\n# Finally, the function returns the length of the result list, which is the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n# The time complexity of this solution is O(N!) because in the worst case, the function needs to make N recursive calls, and each call needs to iterate over N positions. The space complexity is O(N) because the function uses a list to store the column indices of the queens in each row.\n\n# The code is written in Python 3.\n\n# The code is tested on the examples provided in the problem statement and on some additional test cases.
