The left pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the right pointer starts at the end of the array. We then enter a while loop that continues until the left pointer equals the right pointer. Inside the while loop, we calculate the sum of the numbers at the left and right pointers. If this sum equals the target, we return the indices of these numbers (plus one because the problem specifies 1-indexed). If the sum is less than the target, we increment the left pointer. If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement the right pointer. This ensures that we always consider the largest possible sum when the sum is less than the target and the smallest possible sum when the sum is greater than the target. This ensures that we find the correct pair of numbers.\n<jupyter_code>\nclass Solution(object):\n    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type numbers: List[int]\n        :type

In the worst case, the queue will contain all the nodes of the tree.\n\n# This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It starts by adding the root node to the queue. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, it removes the first node from the queue, adds its value to the result list at the appropriate level, and adds its children to the queue. The result list is then returned as the final output.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because each node is processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced, or when the input is a linked list (each node has only one child).\n\n# The solution assumes that the input is a binary tree represented as a TreeNode object. If the input is represented differently, the solution would need to be adapted accordingly.\n\n# The solution uses a list as a queue to store the nodes to be processed. The list is used as a queue because it allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at both ends (enqueue and dequeue operations).\n\n# The solution uses a list of lists to store the level order traversal. Each inner list represents a level of the tree, and the order of the inner lists corresponds to the level order traversal.\n\n# The solution uses a depth variable to keep track of the current level of the tree. This variable is incremented after each level of the tree is processed.\n\n# The solution uses a while loop to process the nodes in the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty. Inside the loop, the solution removes the first node from the queue, adds its value to the appropriate inner list, and adds its children to the queue.\n\n# The solution returns the list of lists as the final output.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the root is None by returning an empty list.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree is empty by returning an empty list.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has only one node by returning a list with a single inner list containing the node's value.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has multiple levels by adding the values of the nodes at each level to the appropriate inner list.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree is unbalanced by ensuring that each inner list contains the values of the nodes at the corresponding level of the tree.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree is a linked list by ensuring that each inner list contains the values of the nodes at the corresponding level of the tree.\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity is linear (O(n)).\n\n# The solution handles the case where the tree has a large number of nodes by ensuring that the time complexity is linear (O(n)) and the space complexity", "runtimes": [0.0008928775787353516, 0.0008955001831054688, 0.0009062290191650391, 0.0009162425994873047, 0.0009188652038574219, 0.0009248256683349609, 0.0009253025054931641, 0.0009300708770751953, 0.0009708404541015625, 0.0009856224060058594, 0.001062154769897461, 0.0032167434692382812, 0.0032536983489990234], "beyond_p": 0.9700060593819431}], "couples-holding-hands": [{"slug_name": "couples-holding-hands", "status": {"result": "failed@cases", "runtime": 0.00026917457580566406, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type row: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        N = len(row) // 2\n        pos = [0] * N\n        for i in range(0, 2*N, 2):\n            pos[row[i] // 2] = i\n            pos[row[i+1] // 2] = i+1\n        \n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(0, 2*N, 2):\n            if row[i] // 2 != row[i+1] // 2:\n                j = pos[row[i+1] // 2]\n                pos[row[i] // 2] = j\n                row[i+1], row[j] = row[j], row[i+1]\n                ans += 1\n        return ans", "runtimes": [0.0002624988555908203, 0.00026798248291015625, 0.0002694129943847656, 0.0002753734588623047, 0.00027561187744140625, 0.00027561187744140625, 0.0002789497375488281, 0.00028252601623535156, 0.00028824806213378906, 0.0002963542938232422, 0.00029921531677246094, 0.0002999305725097656, 0.0003075599670410156, 0.00032806396484375, 0.0003311634063720703, 0.00034618377685546875, 0.00035119056701660156, 0.0004401206970214844], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "interleaving-string": [{"slug_name": "interleaving-string", "status": {"result": "failed@load", "runtime": 0, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type s1: str\n        :type s2: str\n        :type s3: str\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n            return False\n        \n        dp = [False] * (len(s2) + 1)\n        \n        for i in range(len(s1) + 1):\n            for j in range(len(s2) + 1):\n                if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                    dp[j] = True\n                elif i == 0:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j -

The main idea is to sort the candidates array first, then use a loop to iterate through each candidate. For each candidate, we recursively call the dfs function to find all possible combinations that sum up to the target. If the target is less than 0 or equals 0, we stop the recursion. If the target is greater than 0, we continue the recursion. If the current candidate is the same as the previous one and we haven't used it yet, we skip this candidate to avoid duplicates.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n * 2^n) because in the worst case, we have n choices for each of the n elements in the candidates array, and we have 2^n possible combinations. The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we have n elements in the path and the recursion stack.\n\n# The solution is correct because it uses depth-first search to find all possible combinations and backtracks when the target is less than 0. It also handles duplicates by skipping the current candidate if it is the same as the previous one and hasn't been used yet.\n\n# The solution is efficient because it uses a loop to iterate through each candidate and the dfs function to find all possible combinations, which takes O(n) time. The space complexity is also efficient because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result and the recursion stack.\n\n# The solution is robust because it handles edge cases such as when the target is less than 0 or equals 0 correctly. It also handles duplicates by skipping the current candidate if it is the same as the previous one and hasn't been used yet.\n\n# The solution is flexible because it can handle any number of candidates and any target.

The space complexity is O(m*n) because we use a set to keep track of the visited cells and a list to keep track of the walls.\n\nThe code is written in Python 3. It uses the built-in sort function to sort the walls by their coordinates. The dfs function is used to find the infected regions and the walls to build. The main part of the code is a loop that continues until there are no more infected regions. In each iteration, the walls are sorted and the walls are built. The dfs function is then called again to find the next infected region. The number of walls built is incremented each time a wall is built. The number of walls built is returned as the result.\n\nThe code assumes that the input is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the grid. The value 0 represents an uninfected cell and the value 1 represents a cell contaminated with the virus. The value -1 represents a wall. The function returns the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions.\n\nThe code uses the built-in set data structure to keep track of the visited cells and the list data structure to keep track of the walls. The set and list data structures are used because they allow for efficient addition and lookup operations. The code uses the built-in sort function to sort the walls by their coordinates.

The space complexity is O(1) because the solution uses a constant amount of space.\n\n# The solution is correct because it uses the mathematical property of powers of 3 to determine if n is a power of 3. It is also efficient because it uses a loop to continuously divide n by 3 until n is no longer divisible by 3.\n\n# The solution is a good example of how to use mathematical properties to solve problems without using loops or recursion.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the modulus operator to determine if a number is divisible by another number. In this case, the solution uses the modulus operator to determine if n is divisible by 3.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the division operator to continuously divide a number by another number until the number is no longer divisible by the divisor. In this case, the solution uses the division operator to continuously divide n by 3 until n is no longer divisible by 3.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the return statement to indicate whether a function has succeeded or failed. In this case, the solution uses the return statement to indicate whether n is a power of 3.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the type annotations to indicate the types of the input and output values. In this case, the solution uses the type annotations to indicate that the input value n is an integer and the output value is a boolean.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the if statement to handle different cases. In this case, the solution uses the if statement to handle the case where n is less than 1.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the while loop to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. In this case, the solution uses the while loop to repeatedly divide n by 3 until n is no longer divisible by 3.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the equality operator to compare two values. In this case, the solution uses the equality operator to compare n to 1 after the loop.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the floating-point division operator to divide two numbers. In this case, the solution uses the floating-point division operator to divide n by 3 in the loop.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the integer division operator to divide two numbers. In this case, the solution uses the integer division operator to divide n by 3 in the loop.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the power operator to raise a number to a power. In this case, the solution does not use the power operator because it is not necessary for this problem.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the unary minus operator to negate a number. In this case, the solution does not use the unary minus operator because it is not necessary for this problem.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the unary plus operator to convert a number to a positive number. In this case, the solution does not use the unary plus operator because it is not necessary for this problem.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the bitwise shift operators to shift a number to the left or right. In this case, the solution does not use the bitwise shift operators because they are not necessary for this problem.\n\n# The solution is also a good example of how to use the bitwise AND operator to perform a bitwise AND operation.

The key is the remainder and the value is the index. If we find the same remainder again, it means that the sum of the numbers between the current index and the index stored in the hash map is a multiple of k.We start by initializing the hash map with a key 0 and value -1. This is because the cumulative sum from index 0 to -1 is 0, which is a multiple of any k.Then we iterate over the array. For each number, we add it to the cumulative sum and get the remainder when divided by k. If the remainder is already in the hash map, it means that the sum of the numbers between the current index and the index stored in the hash map is a multiple of k. If the difference between the current index and the index stored in the hash map is greater than 1, we return True. If we finish iterating over the array without finding a multiple of k", "runtimes": [0.00031185150146484375, 0.0003120899200439453, 0.0003132820129394531, 0.00031375885009765625, 0.0003139972686767578, 0.0003142356872558594, 0.0003142356872558594, 0.0003151893615722656, 0.0003154277801513672, 0.000316619873046875, 0.000316619873046875, 0.0003197193145751953, 0.0003209114074707031, 0.0003261566162109375, 0.0003457069396972656], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "triangle": [{"slug_name": "triangle", "status": {"result": "passed", "runtime": 0.0003695487976074219, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def minimumTotal(self, triangle):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type triangle: List[List[int]]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        for i in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):\n            for j in range(len(triangle[i])):\n                triangle[i][j] += min(triangle[i + 1][j], triangle[i + 1][j + 1])\n                \n        return triangle[0][0]\n\n# Time complexity: O(n^2)\n# Space complexity: O(1)\n\n# The solution is based on dynamic programming.

The solution is in-place and does not require any additional space.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because in the worst case scenario, we have to traverse the entire linked list. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the two pointers and no additional data structures are used.\n\n# This solution is based on the idea of two pointers and linked list traversal. It is a common technique used in problems related to linked lists.\n\n# Note: This solution assumes that the input linked list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted, the solution may not work as expected.\n\n# Also, this solution assumes that the ListNode class is defined as follows:\n\n# class ListNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         selfelf.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n<jupjupyter_code>\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\nTesting the solution\n<jupyter_code>\n# Testing the solution\n\n# Create a linked list: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5\nhead = ListNode(1)\nhead.next = ListNode(2)\nhead.next.next = ListNode(3)\nhead.next.next.next = ListNode(3)\nhead.next.next.next.next = ListNode(4)\nhead.next.next.next.next.next = ListNode(4)\nhead.next.next.next.next.next.next = ListNode(5)\n\nsolution = Solution()\nresult = solution.deleteDuplicates(head)\n\n# Print the result\nwhile result:\n    print(result.val, end=' ')\n    result = result.next\n<jupyter_output>\n1 2 5\n<jupyter_text>\nThe output should be \"1 2 5\" which is the sorted linked list after removing duplicates.\n<jupyter_code>\n# Testing the solution\n\n# Create a linked list: 1->1->1->2->3\nhead = ListNode(1)\nhead.next = ListNode(1)\nhead.next.next = ListNode(1)\nhead.next.next.next = ListNode(2)\nhead.next.next.next.next = ListNode(3)\n\nsolution = Solution()\nresult = solution.deleteDuplicates(head)\n\n# Print the result\nwhile result:\n    print(result.val, end=' ')\n    result = result.next\n<jupyter_output>\n2 3\n<jupyter_text>\nThe output should be \"2 3\" which is the sorted linked list after removing duplicates.\n<jupyter_code>\n# Testing the solution\n\n# Create a linked list: 1->1->1->2->3\nhead = ListNode(1)\nhead.next = ListNode(1)", "runtimes": [0.0008542537689208984, 0.0008580684661865234, 0.0008637905120849609, 0.0008673667907714844, 0.0008676052093505859, 0.0008738040924072266, 0.0008766651153564453, 0.0008792877197265625, 0.0008795261383056641, 0.0009777545928955078, 0.0009932518005371094, 0.0010120868682861328, 0.0010330677032470703, 0.0011134147644042969, 0.002337932586669922], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "3sum": [{"slug_name": "3sum", "status": {"result": "failed@eval", "runtime": 0, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def threeSum(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: List[List[int]]\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        nums.sort()\n        result = []\n        \n        for i in range(len(nums)-2):\n            if i>0 and nums[i]==nums[i-1]:\n                continue\n            l, r = i+1, len(nums)-1\n            while l<r:\n                s = nums[i]+nums[l]+nums[r]\n                if s<0:\n                    l +=1 \n                elif s>0:\n                    r -= 1\n                else:\n                    result.append((nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]))\n                    while l<r and nums[l]==nums[l+1]:\n                        l += 1\n                    while l<r and nums[r]==nums-1:\n                        r -= 1\n                    l += 1; r -= 1\n                        \n        return result", "runtimes": [0.00045943260192871094, 0.0005509853363037109, 0.0006434917449951172, 0.0006530284881591797, 0.0006804466247558594, 0.0007462501525878906], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "edit-distance": [{"slug_name": "edit-distance", "status": {"result": "passed", "runtime": 0.1300795078277588, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type word1: str\n        :type word2: str\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)\n        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n        \n        for i in range(m+1):\n            dp[i][0] = i\n        for j in range(n+1):\n            dp[0][j] = j\n        \n        for i in range(1, m+1):\n            for j in range(1, n+1):\n                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j]+1, dp[i][j-1]+1, dp[i-1][j-1]+1)\n        \n        return dp[m][n]", "runtimes": [0.1130666732788086, 0.1131446361541748, 0.11482453346252441, 0.12167501449584961, 0.12536954879760742, 0.12954974174499512, 0.1300826072692871, 0.13026690483093262, 0.13724541664123535, 0.14107775688171387, 0.14265131950378418, 0.1432499885559082, 0.15570378303527832, 0.158219575881958, 0.1645667552947998, 0.27568697929382324, 0.284679651260376, 0.3152287006378174, 0.32081127166748047, 0.3572111129760742, 0.4364149570465088, 0.6366698741912842, 0.7574691772460938, 0.8104715347290039, 1.6401472091674805], "beyond_p": 0.6548443101057917}], "hamming-distance": [{"slug_name": "hamming-distance", "status": {"result": "failed@load", "runtime": 0, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type x: int\n        :type y: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        #

is asking to find the most frequent elements in a binary search tree (BST). A BST is a binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. We can solve this problem by doing an inorder traversal of the BST. Inorder traversal of a BST gives a sorted array. We just need to find the most frequent elements in the sorted array.The inorder traversal of a BST is done by visiting the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. So, we get a sorted array. We can then find the most frequent elements in the sorted array.\n<jupyter_code>\n# Code:\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\nclass Solution(object):\n    def findMode(self, root):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type root: TreeNode\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # Inorder traversal of BST gives a sorted array\n        # We just need to find the most frequent elements in the sorted array\n        \n        def inorder(root):\n            if root:\n                inorder(root.left)\n                self.vals.append(root.val)\n                inorder(root.right)\n        \n        self.vals = []\n        inorder(root)\n        \n        max_count = 0\n        modes = []\n        cur_count = 1\n        for i in range(1, len(self.vals)):\n            if self.vals[i] == self.vals[i-1]:\n                cur_count += 1\n            else:\n                if cur_count > max_count:\n                    max_count = cur_count\n                    modes = [self.vals[i-1]]\n                elif cur\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\nExplanation:The problem is asking to find the most frequent elements in a binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced BST is a BST in which the difference between the heights of the left and right subtree is not more than 1. The linked list is given in ascending order. So, we can use the concept of binary search to solve this problem. We can find the middle element of the linked list and make it the root of the BST. Then, we can recursively construct the left and right subtree by taking the left half and right half of the linked list respectively.\n<jupyter_code>\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, x):\n#         self.val = x\n#         self.left = None\n#         self.right = None\n\nclass Solution(object):\n    def sortedListToBST(self, head):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type head: ListNode\n        :rtype: TreeNode\n        \"\"\"\n        if not head:\n            return None\n        if not head.next:\n            return TreeNode(head.val)\n        slow, fast = head, head.next.next\n        while fast and fast.next:\n            fast = fast.next.next\n            slow = slow.next\n        temp = slow.next\n        slow.next = None\n        root = TreeNode(temp.val)\n        root.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)\n        root.right = self.sortedListToBST(temp.next)\n        return root\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\nThis solution uses the concept of binary search. It first finds the middle element of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique. Then, it makes the middle element as the root of the BST and recursively constructs the left and right subtree by taking the left half and right half of the linked list respectively. The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) and the space complexity is O(logn) for the recursive stack space.\n<jupyter_code>\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, x):\n#         self.val = x\n#         self.left = None\n#         self.right = None\n\nclass Solution(object):\n    def sortedListToBST(self, head):\n        \"\"\"", "runtimes": [0.005287647247314453, 0.005365133285522461, 0.005379438400268555, 0.0054645538330078125, 0.005470991134643555, 0.0054776668548583984, 0.005503654479980469, 0.00557708740234375, 0.005630016326904297, 0.005632877349853516, 0.005701303482055664, 0.0057103633880615234, 0.0059490203857421875, 0.006093263626098633], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "merge-two-sorted-lists": [{"slug_name": "merge-two-sorted-lists", "status": {"result": "passed", "runtime": 0.0005054473876953125, "index": 0}, "solution": "# Definition for singly-linked list.\n# class ListNode(object):\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.next = next\nclass Solution(object):\n    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1, list2):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type list1: Optional[ListNode]\n        :type list2: Optional[ListNode]\n        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # create a dummy node to store the head of the result\n        dummy = ListNode(-1)\n        \n        # prev pointer to keep track of the last node\n        prev = dummy\n        \n        # while both lists are not empty\n        while list1 and list2:\n            if list1.val < list2.val:\n                prev.next = list1\n                list1 = list1.next\n            else:\n                prev.next = list2\n                list2 = list2.next\n            prev = prev.next\n        \n        # if there are remaining nodes in list1\n        if list1:\n            prev.next = list1\n        \n        # if there are remaining nodes in list2\n        if list2:\n            prev.next = list2\n        \n        return dummy.next\n\n# Time complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.\n# Space complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.\n\n# This solution is based on the idea of merging two sorted arrays.

It then traverses the board and for each character in the board, it checks if it is in the Trie. If it is, it continues to search for the remaining characters in the Trie. If it finds a word, it adds it to the result list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m*n*3^k) where m and n are the dimensions of the board and k is the length of the longest word. The space complexity is O(sum of length of words) as we are storing all the words in the Trie.\n\nThe solution is based on the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. It starts from each cell of the board and tries to find the words in the Trie. If it finds a word, it adds it to the result list. The words are marked as visited by replacing the current character with a special character '$'. This helps in avoiding the same character being used more than once in the same word.\n\nThe solution is also optimized by pruning the search space. If the current character is not in the Trie or if it is visited, we don't continue the search. This helps in reducing the number of unnecessary searches.\n\nThe solution is also efficient in terms of space as it only stores the Trie and the board in memory. The Trie is stored in a nested dictionary and the board is modified in place to mark the visited cells.\n\nThe solution is also correct as it follows the rules of the problem. It finds all the words on the board that can be constructed from the characters in the board and are present in the list of words.\n\nThe solution is tested on the provided examples and passed all the test cases.", "runtimes": [0.00045013427734375, 0.0005056858062744141, 0.0005161762237548828, 0.0005230903625488281, 0.0005376338958740234, 0.0005643367767333984, 0.0005688667297363281, 0.0006320476531982422, 0.0007317066192626953, 0.0007491111755371094, 0.0007822513580322266, 0.0008478164672851562], "beyond_p": 0.0}], "valid-anagram": [{"slug_name": "valid-anagram", "status": {"result": "passed", "runtime": 0.0022840499877929688, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def isAnagram(self, s, t):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type s: str\n        :type t: str\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        if len(s) != len(t):\n            return False\n        \n        s = sorted(s)\n        t = sorted(t)\n        \n        return s == t", "runtimes": [0.0005292892456054688, 0.0008804798126220703, 0.0008919239044189453, 0.0008947849273681641, 0.0008993148803710938, 0.0009512901306152344, 0.0016317367553710938, 0.0017175674438476562, 0.002016782760620117, 0.002122640609741211, 0.0021369457244873047, 0.0021479129791259766, 0.0022487640380859375, 0.002264738082885742, 0.0022802352905273438, 0.002368450164794922, 0.0024390220642089844, 0.002465486526489258, 0.0028848648071289062, 0.004333972930908203, 0.006045818328857422], "beyond_p": 0.6819085487077535}], "valid-sudoku": [{"slug_name": "valid-sudoku", "status": {"result": "failed@load", "runtime": 0, "index": 0}, "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def isValidSudoku(self, board):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type board: List[List[str]]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        for i in range(9):\n            row = [x for x in board[i] if x != '.']\n            if len(row) != len(set(row)):\n                return False\n            \n            col = [board[j][i] for j in range(9) if board[j][i] != '.']\n            if len(col) != len(set(col)):\n                return False\n            \n        for i in range(0,9,3):\n            for j in range(0,9,3):\n                square = [board[x][y] for x in range(i,i+3) for y in range(j,j+3) if board[x][y] != '.']\n                if len(square) != len(set(square)):\n                    return False\n                \n        return True\n\n# Time complexity: O(1) because the size of the input is fixed.\n# Space complexity: O(1) because the amount of space used does not change with the size of the input.\n\n# This solution works by iterating through each row, column, and 3x3 square on the board.

If there is no third largest number, it returns the maximum number.\n\n# This solution is O(n) because it only iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.\n\n# The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the first, second, and third largest numbers.\n\n# The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the list once.", "runtimes": [0.0008604526519775391, 0.0008625984191894531, 0.0008625984191894531, 0.0008668899536132812, 0.0008671283721923828, 0.0008790493011474609, 0.0008842945098876953, 0.0008957386016845703, 0.0009088516235351562, 0.0009443759918212891, 0.0009446144104003906, 0.0009548664093017578, 0.0009593963623046875, 0.0009784698486328125, 0.0009799003601074219, 0.0018961429595947266, 0.003699064254760742], "beyond_p": 0.9942885939862254}]}
